# 3-ary_MinHeap

3-ary Min Heap is a project I wrote for my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms class at LSU. Similar to a binary heap, where each node has up to 2 children, a 3-ary heap has up to 3 children. This program takes an input File/String with instructions for Insert "IN", DecreaseKey "DK" and ExtractMin "EM". This program follows the commands and then prints the final ExtractMin value.

In this program, I used and refined skills such as Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithm Design and Logic, and the Heap Data Structure.
